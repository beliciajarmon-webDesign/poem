    <h1> Willow Tree</h1>
    <p> deep in the <em>dark</em> of the forest <br>
   there lies a willow tree <br> far from the rays of the sun <br> and the quiet buzz of the bees <br> <br> all who journey to see it <br>are filled with so much glee <br> as all their <strong>sorrows</strong> leave them <br> for the weeping willow tree <br> <br> generations have <strong>revered</strong> it <br> at its sight they take a knee <br> for they know the source of their joy <br> is the weeping willow tree <br> <br> the people return to the sunlight <br> light it will never see <br> for it remains in the forest <br> the <em>weeping</em> willow tree</p>
